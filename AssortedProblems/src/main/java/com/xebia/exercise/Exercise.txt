There are three types of Machines, Machine1 Machine2 and Machine3. 
There are three types of validators, Validator1 , Validator2 , Validator3.

Each Validator validates each machine differently.

Write Java classes to design the above problem.

The program runs from a main function , which already has the list of validators and machines.
Each Validator should print a message during validation 

"Validator X validating Machine Y";

Logic of validation is not required , you can just assume that all machines are valid/invalid.

Also , Please do make assumption on your own if you think anything is missing.

Good Luck!
